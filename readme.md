# DSA Series

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) question-solving journey!

## About

This repository documents my progress as I tackle various DSA problems. My goal is to strengthen my understanding of fundamental concepts, improve problem-solving skills, and prepare for technical interviews.

## Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees & Graphs
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Sorting & Searching
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Hashing

## Approach

For each topic, I solve multiple problems, analyze different approaches, and optimize solutions for efficiency. I include code, explanations, and insights gained from each challenge.
